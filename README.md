A library to convert birthdate to numerology number. Can be used to study of numbers, such as the figures in a birth date, and of their supposed influence on human affairs.

## What is nomerology
Wikipedia describes numerology as below:

> Numerology (also known as arithmancy) is the study of an occult, divine or mystical relationship between a number and one or more coinciding events. It is also the study of the numerical value, via an alphanumeric system, of the letters in words and names. When numerology is applied to a person's name, it is a form of onomancy. It is often associated with the paranormal, alongside astrology and similar to divinatory arts.
> Despite the long history of numerological ideas, the word "numerology" is not recorded in English before c. 1907.

> The term numerologist can be used for those who place faith in numerical patterns and draw pseudoscientific inferences from them, even if those people do not practice traditional numerology. For example, in his 1997 book Numerology: Or What Pythagoras Wrought, mathematician Underwood Dudley uses the term to discuss practitioners of the Elliott wave principle of stock market analysis.
